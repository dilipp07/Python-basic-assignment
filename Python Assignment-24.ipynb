Recursive approaches are often used in algorithms like tree traversals, graph traversals, sorting (e.g., merge sort, quicksort), and searching (e.g., binary search on a sorted list). However, it's important to design recursive functions carefully to ensure they terminate and avoid unnecessary overhead."

   "source": [
    "Single Responsibility Principle (SRP): Functions should have a single, well-defined responsibility. Each function should perform a specific task or solve a specific problem. This makes the code more modular and easier to understand, test, and maintain.\n",
    "\n",
    "Keep functions small: Functions should be kept relatively small and focused. Ideally, a function should fit on a single screen without scrolling. Breaking down complex tasks into smaller functions improves readability and makes code easier to understand and debug.\n",
    "\n",
    "Meaningful names: Use descriptive and meaningful names for functions that accurately convey their purpose or what they do. Avoid generic names like \"processData\" or \"handleInput.\" Clear and concise names make the code self-explanatory and easier to read.\n",
    "\n",
    "Function parameters: Minimize the number of function parameters to avoid excessive complexity. If a function has too many parameters, it can be a sign that it's trying to do too much. Consider grouping related parameters into objects or structs for better readability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Avoid global state: Functions should generally rely on local state and input parameters rather than modifying global variables. Minimizing the use of global state improves the predictability and testability of functions, as their behavior becomes self-contained.\n",
    "\n",
    "Error handling: Handle errors and exceptions properly within functions. Make sure to communicate failures or exceptional cases through well-defined return values or exceptions. Proper error handling enhances the reliability and robustness of the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Code reusability: Design functions to be reusable whenever possible. Identify common functionality that can be extracted into separate functions or utility modules. Reusable functions reduce code duplication and make it easier to maintain and update the codebase.\n",
    "\n",
    "Comments and documentation: Include clear and concise comments to explain the purpose, behavior, and usage of functions."
